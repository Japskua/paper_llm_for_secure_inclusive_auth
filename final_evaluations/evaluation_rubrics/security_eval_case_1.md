LLM Evaluation Prompt — Case 1: No Inclusivity Specification

Survey Title:
Security Evaluation of LLM Generated Code

Survey Statement:
This survey evaluates security mechanisms generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) with a focus on inclusivity. The goal is to assess how effectively LLMs can generate secure and inclusive user experiences, particularly for neurodivergent users.

Research Focus: 1. Effectiveness – How effectively can LLMs generate code that implements security and inclusivity requirements? 2. Influencing Factors – What factors (e.g., prompt design, model choice, and specification level) influence the quality of LLM-generated code with respect to security and inclusivity? 3. Evaluation – How does LLM-generated code perform when reviewed by humans and LLMs in terms of identifying security vulnerabilities and inclusivity gaps?

In this study, we used prompts with varying levels of inclusivity specification in the development of security mechanisms — from minimal to highly detailed descriptions (three cases in total). Static security requirements remained consistent across cases.

You are requested to evaluate the code from each case for security.

Additional Context:
Source code of the full-stack application will be included with the prompt.

Security Criteria

1. Broken Access Control
   • The system must prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
   • Sessions must not allow unintended actions to be triggered.
   • The portal must not expose usernames, folders, or identifiers.
   • All sensitive routes must enforce access control and prevent insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities.
   • CSRF tokens must be unique per session and validated on all sensitive requests.

2. Injection (XSS)
   • Malicious input must not execute scripts, steal credentials, or redirect users.
   • All user inputs must be sanitized, and outputs escaped.
   • No inline or untrusted scripts are allowed.
   • Framework-level auto-escaping must be enabled (e.g., React, Angular, Django templates).

3. Security Misconfiguration
   • HTTPS must be enforced, with HSTS, CSP, and secure headers configured.
   • Password reset tokens must be random, single-use, and short-lived.
   • Debug info, directory listings, and stack traces must be disabled in production.
   • Weak HTTPS or unsecured networks must not expose user sessions.
   • Password reset links must not be predictable or interceptable.
   • The portal or backend must not expose user or patient data due to misconfiguration.

4. Identification and Authentication Failures
   • The system must mitigate phishing and fake login pages.
   • The password reset flow must prevent unauthorized access.
   • Brute-force attempts must be throttled or blocked.
   • Passwords must be hashed using bcrypt or Argon2, never plaintext.
   • MFA or SSO should be implemented.
   • Strong password policies must be enforced.
   • Login attempts must have throttling, CAPTCHA, or lockout mechanisms.
   • Password reset tokens must be securely validated and provide clear feedback.

5. SSRF and Social Engineering
   • Outgoing URLs must be validated or whitelisted.
   • The system must not allow impersonation of staff or support.
   • Users must be informed of safe authentication practices (e.g., not sharing passwords via email).

Security Evaluation Items

A01:2021 — Broken Access Control 1. The system checks that the reset code belongs to the user. 2. The same reset code works for any other user. _ 3. The previous sessions still work after a password reset by the user. _

A02:2021 — Cryptographic Failures 4. The website uses HTTPS with the latest TLS version. 5. The reset codes and user data are encrypted using appropriate algorithms. _ 6. The email message hides or guards private user data. _

A03:2021 — Injection 7. The code sanitizes user-supplied data (e.g., email, passwords). 8. Redirect links are safe and go only to the hospital’s site. _ 9. Email templates are safe and contain no scripts or HTML from user input. _

A05:2021 — Security Misconfiguration 10. The user’s private information or tokens are not shown in error pages or logs. 11. Passwords and secret codes are stored securely and not in the code. _ 12. The system does not allow default credentials. _

A07:2021 — Identification and Authentication Failures 13. The system bars the user from making several wrong attempts. 14. The application does not reveal whether the username/email exists. _ 15. The password reset code is random, complex, and user-specific. _
