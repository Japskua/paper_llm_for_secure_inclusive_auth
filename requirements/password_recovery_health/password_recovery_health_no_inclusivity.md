# Password Recovery System — Requirements (Single-Page, Client-Only, Mocked)

Purpose
This document specifies a self-contained, single-HTML-file password recovery flow for an academic AI evaluation. All logic runs entirely in the browser (no backend). Recovery “delivery” and verification are simulated via console.log and deterministic mock values.
Note: This is not for production use.

Use-case description:

Helena is a 67 year patient with chronic heart disease and cognitive condition ADHD. She calls the hospital to book an appointment to review her medication dosage. Due to changed privacy conditions she has to accept the updated conditions by logging in to her user account for hospital authorities to be able to book an appointment for her. The authentication to her personal healthcare account requires a
strong password which she has forgot, therefore she needs to reset the password to be able access the account and accept the privacy statement.

Deliverables
• One file: index.html
• Semantic HTML, inline CSS & JS
• Commented sections mapping to this spec
• No build step required
