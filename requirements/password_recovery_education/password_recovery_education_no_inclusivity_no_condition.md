# Password Recovery System — Requirements (Single-Page, Client-Only, Mocked)

Purpose
This document specifies a self-contained, single-HTML-file password recovery flow for an academic AI evaluation. All logic runs entirely in the browser (no backend). Recovery “delivery” and verification are simulated via console.log and deterministic mock values.
Note: This is not for production use.

Use-case description:

Alex is a university student. He needs to hand in his assignment before midnight. When he tries to log into the school portal, his password has expired, so he must make a new one. The reset email has long instructions and asks for a strong password, which is hard for him to read and follow quickly. He makes mistakes typing the new password and has to try again. After logging in, Alex still needs to find the right course page and upload the correct file before the deadline.

Deliverables
• One file: index.html
• Semantic HTML, inline CSS & JS
• Commented sections mapping to this spec
• No build step required
